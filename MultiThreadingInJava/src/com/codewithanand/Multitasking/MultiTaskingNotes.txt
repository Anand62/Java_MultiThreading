🖥️ What is Multitasking?
Multitasking is the ability of a system to execute multiple tasks (processes or threads) simultaneously.

🔹 In a single-core processor, multitasking is achieved using time-sharing (switching between tasks quickly).
🔹 In a multi-core processor, true multitasking happens where different tasks run on separate cores at the same time.

Types of Multitasking in Java
-------------------------------
	1️⃣ Process-Based Multitasking
		Multiple independent programs (processes) run simultaneously.
		Each process has its own memory and resources.
	
	🛠 Example:
			Running Chrome, Notepad, and Spotify at the same time.
			
	Each app runs as a separate process in the OS.
	
	2️⃣ Thread-Based Multitasking
		A single process runs multiple threads simultaneously.
		Threads share memory and resources, making execution faster and efficient than processes.

🛠 Example: 
	A text editor where:
	One thread handles UI updates,
	Another thread auto-saves the document,
	Another thread checks spelling in real time.
